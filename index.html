    <h1>Lim Ah Seng Portfolio</h1>
    <h2>Something about Myself</h2>
    I am a student who is studying in Bravo Secondary School. I believe that studying in school may not be such a good idea as I have to spend a lot of time attending lessons and doing homework, instead of pursuing my interests.
    
    <h2>Subjects I (Have to) Take</h2>
    English, Mathematics, Science, History
    
    <h2>My Interests</h2>
    I am learning coding on my own, something which I believe is practical. I love to play football and pool, so I joined to football CCA in my school. From time to time, I sign up for coding competitions.
    
    <h2>Achievements</h2>
    Brainwack 2020, 2021: Finalist
    Robotics Nationals 2020: Top 8
    Top scorer for my football team
